# advent2019

My work on [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in Swift.

If you're looking, note I often move code into a file in the Sources folder for performance reasons.

To run my solutions:

* Check out https://github.com/dpassage/AdventLib in a directory next to this one; it contains code common to many solutions, like a 2D array.
* Open `Advent2019.xcworkspace`
* Hit command-B to build the framework
* Pick a page from the playground and run!
